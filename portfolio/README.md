# Hoofer's Portfolio
**Last Updated:** **

Hi there! I'm a small developer that does some fun coding projects.
Most of my work is done in the following languages:
Lua, C#, JavaScript, and Java


# Notice

  - A lot of projects here were either commissioned to me or made merely for fun. Some of these projects weren't made to be optimized, just for concepts.

## Rocket Game (Unity)
