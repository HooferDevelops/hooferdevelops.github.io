# Hoofer's Minecraft Plugins for 1.15.2+

These are my minecraft plugins made for version 1.15.2 on Spigot.


## Notice

  - These plugins were made for special use cases. Some plugins may require Vault (1.15.2) or EssentialsX (1.15.2), thanks!

## Source Code

  - All of my plugins are open sourced, feel free to see how things work. I'm new to Java, so things might look a little weird. Apologies in advance!

  - "/pvp": Enables/disables pvp. The other targets must have this enabled to be able to hurt them.
