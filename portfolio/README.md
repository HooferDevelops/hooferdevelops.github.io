**Last Updated:** *12/11/2020*

Hi there! I'm a small developer that does some fun coding projects.
Most of my work is done in the following languages:
Lua, C#, JavaScript, and Java


# Notice

  - A lot of projects here were either commissioned to me or made merely for fun. Some of these projects weren't made to be optimized, just for concepts.

# Projects
## Roblox Games
Here's some Roblox projects I've worked on!
### Gameboy Advance Emulator

	This game is not public for copyright reasons, however I can give specific people access to the game. 
### Roblox VR Framework

	A simple VR framework that allows you to fly around and interact with objects. It requires a VR headset.
### Woodstock Co.
https://www.roblox.com/games/5069622755/Woodstock-Co
	
	A Lumber Tycoon 2 inspired game. This game is still actively being worked on with a big team, however I am the main scripter. 
### Epic Battlegrounds
https://www.roblox.com/games/5374466990/Epic-Battlegrounds-Archived

	This game was a minigame themed game that I worked on with a friend, however development was haulted as the group owner account was terminated. The game is now archived on my profile.
	
## Discord Bot Framework
    Discord Bot Framework is what I use to base all my Discord bots off of. This framework is coded in NodeJS and is meant to make your experience with bots easier.

## Roblox RAP Scraper
    This scraper was a commission as a Roblox message bot to message people over a certain amount of RAP. This worked fine, however all source code is private as this was a paid job.

## Rocket Game (Unity)
    Rocket Game is a game I am currently developing in my free time. The game is built around logic, puzzles, and a complicated movement style. The game is made to make people get angry really fast, while being dedicated to beat the game.

## Minecraft Plugins
    All of my plugins were made in Java and were for a specific private server in mind. These were merely for practice and learning experiences.
