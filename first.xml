    <p>This is the first official post for hooferdevelops.github.io</p>
    
    <p>I am doing this post to test how everything is functioning, <i>fingers crossed</i> it will work! ðŸ¤ž</p>
    
    <p>Mainly wanted to create this site for infographs and development logs, it will be interesting to see how everything turns out. I am <i>quite</i> proud of this as it is the first site I have fully completed using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.</p>
  
    <p>That is all I will say for this post, thank you for tuning in!</p>
